    heyⓋ's Mini Story

    </h1>
    <p> Hello everyone! My alias is Ⓥ I am a producer from Lakeland, FL. I've been producing and sound designing for about 4 1/2 years now.
        What once was just a hobby for me has now become one of my ultimate goals in life. I started back in high school in 10th grade, I was taught by my two great friends, and with their knowledge i was able to expand and turn what I learned into my own sound. It has been a great journey for me and many things have come along good and bad, but I would'nt change a thing. I will continue to strive for greater heights, and seek out what the future has in store for me. 
    </p>
